Data Description

For a full description of how the raw data are generated, please see that article when/if it is published.

The data provided are generated by thresholding the raw practically perfect data using common SPC product probability thresholds.  
Each variable within the netcdf file represents the grids "activated" by each threshold for each daily period.  
In other words, these grids would be within that particular contour line. 
'pp_qt' is just the combination of all of these, and contains values from 0 (< 2%) to 7 (>= 60 %). 
Not all of these data are used in the manuscript.
